'''
EXERCISE: Glass Identification (aka "Glassification")
'''

# TASK 1: read the data into a DataFrame

# TASK 2: briefly explore the data

# TASK 3: convert into binary classification problem

# TASK 4: create a feature matrix (X) using all features

# TASK 5: create a response vector (y)

# TASK 6: split X and y into training and testing sets

# TASK 7: fit a KNN model on the training set using K=5

# TASK 8: make predictions on the testing set and calculate testing accuracy

# TASK 9: write a for loop that computes testing accuracy for a range of K values

# TASK 10: plot K value versus testing accuracy to choose on optimal value for K

# TASK 11: calculate the null accuracy

# TASK 12: search for useful features

# redo exercise using only those features
